# Neo-Samson-Game
This is a game I made for my Intro Python class. It is based on an idea from my brother. 

The game is pretty simple. It's a wave survival game. I want to implement drops and much more. Perhaps in the future there will be updates. However, nothing complex here. Just some good ole' fun.
